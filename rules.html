            <h1>Offense</h1>
            In volleyball, offense means the techniques and tactics by the team controlling the ball. It includes reception of the serve (bump or forearm pass), setting and attacking (spiking) the ball. The serve is also an offensive action.<br><br>

Offensive Plays:
Virtually all teams run coordinate team patterns or playsâ€”much the same as a basketball or football team might run. The following are a few common examples used by teams employing a multiple offense. (Refer to ZONES OF NET AREA).

Option Four: A play designed to isolate (free from blockers) the left front spiker. Left front expects a 4 set (shoot), middle front expects a 1 set (Jap) and right front expects a regular set.
Double Quick: A play designated to isolate the right front spiker. Left front expects a regular set, middle front expects a 1 set and right front expects a back set 2.
X-Play: A play designated to isolate the right front spiker hitting from the middle front position. Left front expects a regular set, center front expects a Jap set and right front takes a move similar to the double quick but then crosses, behind the CF spikes and hits a 2 set in the middle of the court.
