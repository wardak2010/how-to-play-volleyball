            <h1>Offense</h1>
            In volleyball, offense means the techniques and tactics by the team controlling the ball. It includes reception of the serve (bump or forearm pass), setting and attacking (spiking) the ball. The serve is also an offensive action.<br><br>

Offensive Plays:
Virtually all teams run coordinate team patterns or plays—much the same as a basketball or football team might run. The following are a few common examples used by teams employing a multiple offense. (Refer to ZONES OF NET AREA).

Option Four: A play designed to isolate (free from blockers) the left front spiker. Left front expects a 4 set (shoot), middle front expects a 1 set (Jap) and right front expects a regular set.
Double Quick: A play designated to isolate the right front spiker. Left front expects a regular set, middle front expects a 1 set and right front expects a back set 2.
X-Play: A play designated to isolate the right front spiker hitting from the middle front position. Left front expects a regular set, center front expects a Jap set and right front takes a move similar to the double quick but then crosses, behind the CF spikes and hits a 2 set in the middle of the court.

           <h1>Defense</h1>
           The greatest defensive players have the ability to “read the opponent's attack” and position themselves in both a court and body position that allows one to track, pursue and play the ball. This means the defender must play a court position anticipating an attack, but a body position anticipating an off-speed shot and run it down.

For some players this ability is innate and for some it must be instilled and trained, but all players with this ability have one thing in common – they are driven individuals who have the mindset to spontaneously react and go after “every” ball, known by many as relentless pursuit of the ball. This positioning is heavily dependent on the placement of the opponent's set (off net or tight) and the formation of the team block (single, double, line and/or angle). A player who can anticipate and read the situation as it develops will have the jump on those that don’t, won’t or can’t.
